📊 Bank of Baroda Stock Analysis using Candlestick Charts
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to read stock market data from a CSV file, preprocess it using Python (Pandas, NumPy), and visualize price movements with an interactive Candlestick chart (Plotly).

The stock data used is from Bank of Baroda, and the candlestick visualization helps identify trends, support & resistance levels, and investor sentiment, making it a useful tool for financial analysis and decision-making.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data cleaning & preprocessing

NumPy – Numerical operations

Plotly – Interactive candlestick chart visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Development & demonstration

📂 Project Workflow

Import Libraries – Load required Python libraries.

Load CSV Data – Read Bank of Baroda stock data.

Preprocess Data – Handle missing values, format dates, sort dataset.

Generate Candlestick Chart – Create interactive chart using Plotly.

Interpret Patterns – Analyze trends, support/resistance, and sentiment.

📊 Candlestick Chart Explained

Green/White Candle (Bullish) → Closing price > Opening price

Red/Black Candle (Bearish) → Closing price < Opening price

Wicks (Shadows) → Daily high and low prices

Body → Range between open and close

This charting method provides more context than line graphs, helping traders quickly understand market movements.
